When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

When I am collaborating with others and want to share my code with them.
We could also use remote repository to backup our local repository.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

fork - it is a GitHub feature, when you want to make changes or copy the repository to your own account then you use fork.

clone - it is a Git feature and not specific to GitHub. "clone" is used when we have to create a copy of the repository locally.

branches - they're a part of the repository and we can create them locally or online on GitHub.

I would use fork when I have to get a copy of someone else's repository and make changes to it rather than making changes directly on the main person's repo.

I would use clone when I have to save a copy of the repository locally and push/pull changes to/from it.

I would treat branches as separate folders, if I am working on an experimental feature then I would rather create an experimental branch and would put all my untested changes there.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?

This ensures that we always have the latest copy from the remote esp when we're collaborating so we can avoid any conflicts etc. It also helps to know what changes were made if we're about to work on something so knowing the most recent change is important.
